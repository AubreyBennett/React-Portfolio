            <p>My name is Aubrey Bennett and from 2015-2019 I played D1 softball at Morehead State University. I am currently 23 years old, no longer playing ball, and miss it tremendously. While in college I obtained a bachelor's degree in Neuroscience. In the summers away from school I worked as a dental assistant at Goldstein Garber and Salama LLC. When I graduated I decided to go back to dental assisting and have been doing it ever since. I always had the plan that I wanted to go into the medical field in some form and have recently decided that medical coding may be the way I want to go. Neuroscience is my love and I would love to eventually work in a setting where Neuroscience and coding are combined.</p>
            <p>I have now been coding for a while. You should check out my work! It's featured on my portfolio page. I also have a link to my resume below.</p>
